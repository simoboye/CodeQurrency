A **class** is said to be **thread-safe** if and only of no concurrent execution of method calls or field accesses (read/write) result in race conditions.

A concurrent **program** is said to be **thread-safe** if and only if it is race condition free.

For any program p, p only accesses thread-safe *classes* does not imply that p is a thread-safe *program*.
Since program using thread-safe classes may contain race conditions.
