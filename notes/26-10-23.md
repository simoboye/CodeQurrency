Marsha - define things well - she is very formal

Only about one class - the thread safe calls.

Write a program that executes queries and then make reports.

Know from a theoretical view on how codeql is implemented, we know better what is efficient or not. Is it okay with an external program.
How does datalog make the queries.

Start by focusing on the syncronized this. We can show a case study in the RP. Have several classes and measuring how long this take.
Something that works with all that the definitions for the thread safe class. Mutatable is "only" missing one - focus on one case of that.

Lock free data structures - can we find them in codeql?

Pick case studies and show that they work. Exercises from PCPP.

Thesis - something complex in a real world system.

If we were to show this in a presentation. How would a user use it.

Presentation at exam.
Problem
theory
how we use it
what are the limitation

readers and writers week 2. It could be wrong but we know that it is thread safe.
Person class as a running example for the RP.

Next week focus on syncronized this
Maybe come up with some example, see above
How do we present the result
