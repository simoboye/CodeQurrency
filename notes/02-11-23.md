Don't report immutable fields. 

Don't lock immutable fields, suggest that these should not be in locks.

Research question: Can CodeQL be used to check properties that are required for thread safety?
  - Yes we can do this (our implementation)

Week 2 readers and writers (only checks thread safety and doesn't ensure correctness of the program).

Implement a semaphore using synchronized Herlihy, page 196, figure 8.12

Specification of a semaphore allows at most c threads in the critical section. (how many threads are allowed in the critical section).

Release before you acquire, you can relase and the counter would be negative.

Show some errors that is found with the query.
Changing modifiers, private/final/synchronized

Evaluate how well our tool works. It is very ad hoc and not automatic and systematically. Having some kind of rules of how to mutate the program.

SynchronizedLists?
